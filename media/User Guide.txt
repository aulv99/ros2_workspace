Workspace (C++ or CMake)
Build Specific Package:
colcon build --packages-select amr_control,
    - Compiles only your package (faster than building everything).

Build All:
colcon build
    - Compiles the entire workspace. Use this if you add new dependencies.

Clean Rebuild:
rm -rf build/ install/ && colcon build
    - Deletes old build files and rebuilds from scratch. Fixes ""Zombie CMake"" errors.

Source Environment:
source install/setup.bash,
    - Mandatory. Run this in every new terminal to make ROS ""see"" your built code.



Gazebo:
Launch World:
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
    - "Starts Gazebo with the default ""TurtleBot3 World"" (hexagonal pillars)."

Reset Robot:
ros2 service call /reset_simulation std_srvs/srv/Empty
    - Teleports the robot and objects back to the start without restarting Gazebo.

Kill Gazebo:
pkill -f gazebo
    - Force-quits all Gazebo background processes. Use this if the window freezes or won't close.


Robot Control:
Run Your Node:
ros2 run amr_control go_to_goal
    - Launches your custom C++ controller (Waypoint Patrol).

Manual Teleop:
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
    - Allows you to drive the robot with keyboard keys (WASD/X).

Emergency Stop:
Ctrl + C
    - Stops the currently running node immediately.


Visualization & Debugging:
Launch Rviz:
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup rviz2.launch.py
    - Opens the 3D visualization tool. Remember to set Frame to odom and add /scan.

List Topics:
ros2 topic list
    -Shows all active data streams (e.g., /scan, /odom, /cmd_vel).

Read Topic Data:
ros2 topic echo /odom
    - Prints the live data stream of a topic. Useful to check coordinates (x,y).

Check Nodes: 
ros2 node list
    - Lists all running programs to see if your node crashed or is still active.
